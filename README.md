## ✨ What is Blackrock GO?

Blackrock GO is a lightweight, Burning Mesh–compatible client focused on **reliable communications** and **clear field UX**:

- 🗺️ **Map-first UI** — City map at launch with friend nodes, channels, and time-gated event markers  
- 📡 **Meshtastic via BLE** — Pair with any Meshtastic-flashed radio (Heltec, LilyGO/TTGO, etc.)  
- 🔒 **Camp channels & DMs** — Up to 8 encrypted channels; DMs for 1:1 chat  
- 📍 **Location sharing etiquette** — “Everyone” (public) stays location-OFF by default  
- 🗓️ **Scheduled Events Overlay** — Load a JSON schedule; markers appear only during active windows  
- ⚙️ **Offline-first** — Works without cell/Wi-Fi once paired with your radio
